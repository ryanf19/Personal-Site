<h1>How I Work</h1>

<p>
  This is a brief on how I operate professionally. It's useful for onboarding, meeting new coworkers, and as reminders about working with me. It covers my work style, thought process, and gives some insight into who I am. Consider it a quick guide to understanding me in a work context.
</p>

<h2>My Work Style</h2>
<ul>
    <li>I am highly technical, but also leverage my general business knowledge to understand the technical challenges in context. I can both define the problem and solve it.</li>
    <li>I like to dive deep. I do my best work when I have the chance to load everything into my mind and focus on it uninterrupted.</li>
    <li>I always have an eye for the reframe that makes something take one hour instead of ten.</li>
</ul>

<h2>My Implementation Process</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Identify and gather every bit of information needed in order to solve the problem effectively. When this is all present, decisions come easily.</li>
    <li>Define what success looks like with metrics and set up an infrastructure to rapidly iterate.</li>
    <li>Always focus directly on the highest impact components, while keeping an image together of how it fits into the whole system.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Communication</h2>
<ul>
    <li>I value focused communication. For day-to-day, I prefer messages to be brief and regarding essential matters.</li>
    <li>I prefer going through available resources to find information before inquiring.</li>
    <li>Having a sense of the important aspects of something and what is relevant to who is one of my core communication principles.</li>
    <li>My ideal scenario is all parties having trust. This allows most trivial communications to be eliminated. The assumption becomes I have what I need and things are going well, and I will update you otherwise. And likewise, if there's new information, you will update me.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Me as a Person</h2>
<ul>
    <li>I love doing new things, it can be anything and I'm always picking up new hobbies.</li>
    <li>Running, mountain climbing, and travelling are a few of my passions.</li>
    <li>I like to be focused and effective with work, and relaxed with everything else.</li>
</ul>
